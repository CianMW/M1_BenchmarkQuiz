        QUIZ GAME!

        RULES:
        / The player must guess correctly a certain amount of questions
        / Each correct answer gives him one point
        / Answers could be multiple or true/false
        / At the end of the game, the user must know his/her total score

        QUESTIONS:
        / You can get them from this URL ( http://bit.ly/strive_QUIZZ ) or you can write your own
        / Could be multiple of boolean (true / false)
        / [EXTRA] Show if the answer provided was the wrong one or correct it after clicking
        / [EXTRA] Present the questions one a time instead of having all displayed together

        HINTS:
        / Keep a global variable score for the user score
        / Keep a variable questionNumber for the question the user is answering
        / When questionNumber is bigger then the available questions, present the score
        / Start working with the questions saved in a variable (or you can use AJAX for fetching external questions if you already know it!)
        / Start with the easier version and THEN implement the EXTRAs
        / Please debug everything / try it on the console to be sure of what to expect from your code

        EXTRA:
        / Show if the answer provided was the wrong one or correct it after clicking
        / Present the questions one a time instead of having all displayed together
        / Let the user select difficulty and number of questions (you can get q/a from https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&category=18&difficulty=easy modifying amount and difficulty)

    -->
   
    
    
         <!-- // IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ALL THE QUESTIONS AT ONCE:
          // HINT: for each question, create a container with the "question"
          // create a radio button https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio with, as option the both the correct answer and the incorrect answers
          // when EVERY question has an answer (google for how to get a value from a radio button with JS)
          // IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ONE QUESTION AT A TIME
          // Display first question with a title + radio button
          // when the user select the answer, pick the next question and remove this from the page after added in a varible the users' choice.
        };
  
        // HOW TO calculate the result
        // You can do it in 2 ways:
        // If you are presenting all questions together, just take all the radio buttons and check if the selected answer === correct_answer
        // If you are presenting one question at a time, just add one point or not to the user score if the selected answer === correct_answer ---->
